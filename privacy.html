            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 13, 2026</p>

            <p>Welcome to Eebii. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how information is
                handled when you use our website and services.</p>

            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

            <h3>Free Invoice Generator</h3>
            <p>The Free version of Eebii works entirely in your browser. We do not require login or account creation,
                and we do not store your invoice data on our servers. Any information you enter remains on your device
                and is used only to generate your invoice.</p>

            <h3>Pro Version (SaaS Platform)</h3>
            <p>If you choose to use the Pro version of Eebii, we may collect account information such as name, email
                address, and invoice data to provide cloud storage, login access, and advanced features. This data is
                securely stored and used only to deliver the service.</p>

            <h2>2. Cookies and Advertising</h2>
            <p>Eebii uses third-party advertising services such as Google AdSense to display ads. These services may use
                cookies or similar technologies to show relevant advertisements and improve ad performance.</p>
            <p>You can control or disable cookies through your browser settings.</p>

            <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
            <p>We take reasonable measures to protect user information. The Free version does not store data online,
                while Pro version data is protected using standard security practices.</p>

            <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>Our website may include links or integrations from third-party services such as analytics or advertising
                providers. These services operate under their own privacy policies.</p>

            <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
            <p>Eebii is not intended for use by children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal
                information from children.</p>

            <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any updates will be posted on this page with a
                revised effective date.</p>
